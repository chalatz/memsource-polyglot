Back in 2016, when I became responsible for the Memsource Academic  Edition and our partnerships with academic institutions in general, my  main goal was simple. I wanted to spread the love and present the  benefits of cooperating with Memsource to as many academic institutions  as possible.

As the number of universities offering training in Memsource grew – and  quite significantly, I must compliment myself, as it doubled from 56 to  103 in a year – the objectives began to shift. We used 2017 to better  understand our clients, the professors supporting our program, and  knowing how they worked with Memsource and how we could adapt the  program to better suit their expectations.

I had the invaluable opportunity to peep into the mechanics of a number  of different translation programs, to see how trainings were structured,  and how students get to know about our tool. Thanks to that, I was able  to identify what Memsource could do to further help students become  prepared for the translation industry – and actually offer the  professors a chance to give feedback and talk through future ideas.

The exploration resulted in both the [Memsource Student Certification Program](https://www.memsource.com/memsource-student-certification-program/) being [launched last September](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2018/02/28/certification-notes-students-are-up-for-a-challenge/) and a number of smaller projects such as [interviews with students](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/02/16/rising-translation-talents/), a professor’s input on [being successful in the industry](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2017/08/11/technology-an-essential-part-of-modern-translation-curricula/), and hosting a [contest](https://www.memsource.com/contest/).

_Stay  tuned, we are working with yet another professor on a similar project.  Dr. Dragoș Ciobanu set the bar high with his insights receiving a  significant amount of readers’ attention:_

## Unveiling the Project

The improvement of the academic program  continues in 2018 with the introduction of the Talent Endorsement  Program. Its purpose is to connect top performing certified students  with translation agencies that work with Memsource.

The goal is simple: Offer students an additional chance to get some  external translation practice and to offer translation agencies a way to  connect with skillful students proficient in the Memsource platform  with a potential of becoming longer-term colleagues. We consider this a  win-win.

_“The  industry-academic partnerships play a huge role as they give the  students the opportunity to learn more about what their future work may  entail. At the same time, industry representatives can evaluate  up-and-coming talent.”_

_–_ [Hana Laurenzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanalaurenzo/), Founder and CEO of [Teneo Linguistics Company](https://www.tlctranslation.com/)

The project was started with the help of Hana and the Teneo Linguistics  Company, as well as the two universities where the first student  participants came from: Middlebury Institute of International Studies at  Monterey and University of Puerto Rico.

Hana’s decision to join the pilot project was straightforward: “It  seems there simply is no downside! The linguists who work with us are  the pillar of our business. We rely on them day in and day out.  Therefore, we are always on the lookout for new talent and appreciate  being connected with students who, one day, may become an important  resource to us. We also invest a lot of effort into training and  educating those who work with us. So we have been on the same page with  Memsource from the start.”

Susan and David, the students, joined the ranks of TLC’s freelancers  in August and November 2017 respectively, and have been cooperating with  the agency since then. When asked about benefits the cooperation has  brought them, they were positive in their replies:

_“The  cooperation has helped me practice with the program, and it has also  given me an edge in the translation technology courses I am taking at  the university.”_

## Let It Grow!

Building on the positive feedback and invaluable experience we gained  during the pilot, we’re scaling it into a full-scale project this year.  This means that we will offer it to a larger number of both universities  and translation agencies.

Since we want to be able to ensure high level of knowledge and skills of  the students we promote, however, we have decided to limit the program  to professors and students meeting certain criteria:

* The department has to be part of our [Memsource Student Certification Program](https://www.memsource.com/memsource-student-certification-program/), which means that the professor has to be a [Memsource Certified Trainer](https://www.memsource.com/trainers/). This also means that we have discussed the form of Memsource training with the professor and found it exceptional.
* The student must pass the student certification with excellent results.
* The student must be recommended by their professor.

As meeting these criteria is not easy, we are going to work very  carefully to select agencies to cooperate with on this project as well:

* The agencies will have to pay the student for their work.
* The cooperation will be remote unless agreed otherwise.
* The agencies should have experience with  working with interns/newcomers to the industry, supporting them with  advice and spot-on feedback.

We are aware of the fact that the selection process is quite strict,  and we are proud of that. We believe that it will not only help to  promote viable work connections but also to inspire other universities  to cooperate with us more closely and also work on their curricula to  make them relevant to the current (and future) trends of the translation  industry.

_“I  think this program is a great idea as it gives students real insight  into the industry instead of the ‘textbook’ approach. Real world  experience is always ideal!”_

We are really looking forward to collaborating with all the parties  involved and to learning about the translation programs of universities  that have not become our academic partners yet. This is going to be an  amazing opportunity not only for the agencies and students to gain  experience and build connections but also for us to understand all of  the collaborators’ stories.

After all, this is what drives me forward in my job.

## About the author

[Filip Šanca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipsanca/) is  the Academic Account Manager at Memsource, working with translation  professors and students participating in the Academic Program around the  world. He is currently working on his master’s degree in Serbian  philology at Charles University in Prague.

A little tip: In his master’s thesis, Filip is trying to identify the  best practices used when training students in CAT tools and to, using  different competence frameworks, create a translation technology course  for small language departments that are not entirely  translation-centered, but whose students still need to know the basics.
