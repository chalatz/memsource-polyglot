Memsource has been ranked the 7th fastest growing SaaS company and 4th fastest in Europe by the [SaaS 1000: Top SaaS Companies](http://saas1000.com/) list.

The list requires a minimum of 40 employees and the algorithm  calculates growth based on the number of employees added over the  previous six months.

Memsource, which provides an AI-powered translation management system  for the localization supply chain, is headquartered in Prague and has  offices in Japan and the United States with employees from 14  nationalities. It grew by nearly 58% during the ranking period and has  since added an additional 13 employees for a total of 84 at the time of  the announcement.

With the growth, several new teams were formed with the goal of  expanding business services and generating innovation, such as the [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.memsource.com/blog/2018/01/09/memsource-releasing-first-feature-powered-by-artificial-intelligence/) team, the Quality Assurance team, and the Solutions Architect team.
